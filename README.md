# SAWNet
Spatially aware deep neural network for point cloud analysis


The code uses Tensorflow 1.5.0, Python 2.7 and other generic dependencies.

The model is a residual deep learning architecture to process 3D point clouds in their raw form. The network can be used for various point cloud processing tasks such as classification, segmentation and semantic scene parsing. Please see the paper for more details.
